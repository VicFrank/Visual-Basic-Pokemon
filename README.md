# Visual-Basic-Pokemon
A recreation of Pokemon FireRed up through Pewter City featuring Professor Oak as the main character

Run pokemon1.exe to play.

Move using the arrow keys, talk/perform an action using the enter key, and use the form with buttons that pops up to do everything else.

I never ended up featuring a lot of features (you can't pick up pokeballs, a lot of in between routes are cut out, pewter city is completely unfinished) but I felt pretty proud of it as a highschooler at the time.
